# The Flying Beavers Official App

# Pitch

Flying Beaver is an one-stop-shop family application that allows families to share and view calendars, shopping lists and emergency information. 

Our app aims to create a forum for members of a household to collectively view events, tasks, and items needed.  Currently, other apps allow users to do each of these activities, but our app is better in that it allows users to see all of this information at once in one location.  It provides easier, more convenient access to the information and is supposed to provide similar function as a household’s hard copy of a calendar and to do lists would provide. 

# MVP

Our MVP will be a full stack MERN application that has the following feature:

1. A shopping list component that will allow a user to add products to a list of household items or groceries that are needed.

In addition to the MVP, we would like to add functionality to the components that improve the user experience.  Some nice-to-have improvements that weaspire to have include: 

1. A calendar component that will allow a user to create and save household events to a calendar.
2. A to do list component that will allow a user to add tasks to a list of household chores that need to be completed. 
3. Emoji’s or another way to symbolically indicate the priority with which shopping items should be purchased – for example, which items are needed now or items to purchase only when a user finds a deal on them. 
4. A chat or comment feature on calendar events / shopping / to-do-list items.
5. A raspberry pi serving our application
