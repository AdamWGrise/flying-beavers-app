# Pitch

Clan Manager is an one-stop-shop family application that allows families to share information!  Family members can use the app to view a shared calendar, shopping lists, and information about eachother including birthdays and emergency information. 

Clan Manager is better than other apps which allow users to do one of the activities listed above because it allows users to see all of this information at once in one location. It provides easier, more convenient access to the information and is supposed to provide similar function as a household’s hard copy of a calendar and to do lists would provide. 

# App Features

Our app is a full stack MERN application that has the following features:

1. A login / register page that requires users to register and create a basic profile so that they can login to see information related to their family. 

2. A shared shopping list component that allows users to add products to a list of household items or groceries that are needed from particular stores.

3. A family information component that allows users to enter important informaiton about members, such as their birthdays and emergency contact/health information. 

# Future Improvements

1. A to do list component that will allow a user to add tasks to a list of household chores that need to be completed. 
2. Emoji’s or another way to symbolically indicate the priority with which shopping items should be purchased – for example, which items are needed now or items to purchase only when a user finds a deal on them. 
3. A chat or comment feature on calendar events / shopping / to-do-list items.
4. A raspberry pi serving our application.
